"I will always look upon the work of my salvation, and the foundation and government of our community, as the work of God; hence I will abandon the care of both to him, acting only through his orders;â€¦ I will often consider myself as an instrument which is of no use except in the hands of the workman. Hence I must await the orders of Providence before acting, and be careful to accomplish them when known." ~De La Salle

I chose this quote personally because I think it applies to me as well. There I times when I look at myself and think that I have one purpose in this world: To be of use to God. I believe that God leading me to the path in life where I can serve Him and my community the best. My purpose is the same as everyone else's, and that is to be a sort of tool in the hands of God as He builds a great structure of greatness. Redundant, yes, but that's how it is. Although, this sort of awakens a minor weakness in me, and that is the over dependence of the tool on the workman to do good. I often develop a feeling along the lines of "It's okay to do nothing now, God will eventually pick me up and use me" but I believe that this is the difference between my situation and the situation of a common tool. Tools just sit around doing nothing, waiting for the workman to pick them up and use them for a job, but I realize that we humans are in a different situation. We "tools" can actually do work on our own, easing the burden on the one who uses us. And it is through that that we become effective tools that make our owner proud.
